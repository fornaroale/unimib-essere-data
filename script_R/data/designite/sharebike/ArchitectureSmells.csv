sharebike,club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.root,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.root; club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.vo
sharebike,club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.vo,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.vo; club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.root
sharebike,club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.vo,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.root
sharebike,club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.vo,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Candidate]; [Customer]; [DriverStatusVo; DriverVo]; [IntentionTask]; [Lock]; [Status]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.86
sharebike,club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.service,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: club.newtech.qbike.intention.infrastructure; club.newtech.qbike.intention.domain.core.root.
sharebike,club.newtech.qbike.order.controller,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: club.newtech.qbike.order.domain.service; club.newtech.qbike.order.domain.exception.
