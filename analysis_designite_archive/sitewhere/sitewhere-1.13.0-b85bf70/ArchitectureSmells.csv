Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
sitewhere-1.13.0-b85bf70,com.sitewhere.activemq,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ActiveMQClientEventReceiver]; [ActiveMQClientEventReceiver.ConsumersThreadFactory]; [ActiveMQClientEventReceiver.Consumer]; [ActiveMQInboundEventReceiver]; [ActiveMQInboundEventReceiver.ConsumersThreadFactory]; [ActiveMQInboundEventReceiver.Consumer]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0
sitewhere-1.13.0-b85bf70,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
